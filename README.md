# SleepEDF
This project aims to predict a person's sleep stages using EEG (Electroencephalography) data, leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques. Sleep stages represent different brainwave activities that occur as a person sleeps, and this project processes EEG signals to identify these stages.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

#1. Loading the EEG Data:

EEG devices measure the electrical activity of the brain, and this data is often stored in .edf (European Data Format) files. The project loads the EEG data from one of these files and selects specific channels (EEG signals). In this example, 'EEG Fpz-Cz' and 'EEG Pz-Oz' channels are chosen.

#2. Loading and Processing the Hypnogram (Sleep Stages):

Sleep stages are labels indicating the depth of sleep (such as deep sleep, light sleep, etc.) at specific time intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds). The project loads another .edf file containing these stages and converts the annotations into numerical labels.

Sleep stages are categorized into 'W' (wakefulness), '1' (light sleep), '2' (deep sleep), 'R' (REM sleep), and so on.

#3. Processing EEG Data:

EEG data is typically very long, so it's divided into shorter time intervals called epochs (e.g., 30 seconds). These epochs are mapped to sleep stages, and each epoch corresponds to one sleep stage.

The EEG data is reshaped into a 3D array, where each epoch is represented by a sequence of data from the selected channels.

#4. Scaling the Data:

EEG data can vary in range, so it's scaled using a standard scaler to ensure that the data is normalized. This step helps the model perform better and learn more effectively.

#5. Splitting the Data into Training and Test Sets:

The data is split into training and test sets. The training set is used to teach the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

#6. Building the Model:

The deep learning model is built using a structure called a "Convolutional Neural Network" (CNN), which is effective for recognizing patterns in time-series data, such as EEG signals.

Model layers:

Conv1D: Identifies patterns in the EEG signal that correspond to different sleep stages.

MaxPooling1D: Reduces the data's dimensionality, helping the model learn faster.

Dense and Dropout: Helps to prevent overfitting (learning too much detail from the training data).

Softmax: The final layer that provides predictions for each sleep stage.

#7. Compiling and Training the Model:

The model is trained using the data, where it adjusts its parameters (weights) to minimize the loss (error) and maximize accuracy. The performance is measured using metrics like accuracy and loss.

#8. Evaluating the Model:

After training, the model is evaluated using the test set to see how well it performs on unseen data. The test accuracy and loss values are printed.

#9. Analyzing Incorrect Predictions:

The model's incorrect predictions are analyzed to identify which samples it misclassified. This helps in understanding where the model made mistakes.

#10. Testing with a New EEG Signal:

The model is also tested with a new EEG signal that it has not seen before. This allows us to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new data.

Conclusion:

This project aims to classify sleep stages based on EEG data using deep learning techniques. EEG signals reflect brain electrical activity, and sleep stages correspond to different brainwave patterns. Deep learning models are used to recognize these patterns and predict which sleep stage the person is in.

Sleep Stages:

W (Wake): Wakefulness

1: Light Sleep

2: Deep Sleep

3/4: Very Deep Sleep

R (REM): Rapid Eye Movement sleep, associated with dreaming.

This project can be useful for applications in healthcare, such as detecting sleep disorders or monitoring sleep patterns.
